# DualOptim: Enhancing Efficacy and Stability in Machine Unlearning with Dual Optimizers

## Dataset Overview

The full dataset consists of **4,000 QA pairs**.  
We define three forget sets corresponding to different forgetting ratios:

- **1% forget set (`forget01`)**: 40 samples  
- **5% forget set (`forget05`)**: 200 samples  
- **10% forget set (`forget10`)**: 400 samples  

For each forget set, the remaining samples form the **retain set**.
